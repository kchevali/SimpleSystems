# Simple Systems

## In Short
Personal challenge to build virtual hardware in C++ from scratch.

## Description
This project was an interest that I explored based on my computer organization course. The objective of the project is to develop a virtual system from scratch. My challenge was to build this system in C++ with very strict limitations to simulate building a computer from the very basics and to run a simple yet high level programming language. The first major restrictions was that I was only able to use the NAND gate, variables and classes/methods throughout my application. This means fundamental operations such as if statements, loops (with one exception), and/or/xor gates, ALU ... etc had to built myself. This project is under progress and I have completed the hardware portion of the system (ram & registers & alu & bus...)
